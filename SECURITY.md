# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Whilst AccountableAPI will always ensure the highest levels of security, sometimes bugs do get through numerous levels of tests. In the unlikely event that you find a vunrability, you can report it to us by emailing security@pixelninja.dev. 

The reporter of the vunrability will get a reward for the report if it is considered valid and needs a patch. If the exploit benifits you (such as getting something extra for free like more users), we will compensate you by providing the feature in your plan assuming the feature is reasonable and not a security risk.

For example, if you find a way to use 2fa when you are not paying for it, we will add 2fa to your plan free of charge then patch the bug.
